# Installation

The `Gigaset N870 IP Pro` needs to be set to the correct role to work with Wazo. By default, the
N870 is set only as a *base*, which means that it does not provide a web interface and needs an
external DECT manager to be able to work properly. It is necessary to set it to the **All-in-one**
role if you want to use it with Wazo. See the [Gigaset
documentation](https://teamwork.gigaset.com/gigawiki/display/GPPPO/FAQ+N870+-+Installation) to know
how to change the role.
